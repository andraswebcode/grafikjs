# GrafikJS

**A simple and powerful JavaScript SVG library**

Grafikjs is a simple JavaScript tool for making browser-based games, editors, and animations with SVG graphics. It's easy to use with TypeScript projects and has different packages you can use.
The main concept is to keep the business logic of your software separate from its view. The core package helps you build the core of your app - this will be actually the engine of your app which you can easily integrate with popular frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js.
Grafikjs is optimized for fast performance to help you bring your ideas to life, and it works well with the tools you already use.
